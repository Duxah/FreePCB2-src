FontManager - release notes

v 1.0
-----

This application allows editing of the Hershey font files which are used in FreePCB. It was taken from the following article on CodeProject.

http://www.codeproject.com/gdi/hersheyfont.asp

Bruce Parham modified the code so that the application looks for the font files in the folder that it was opened from, instead of using an absolute path.
