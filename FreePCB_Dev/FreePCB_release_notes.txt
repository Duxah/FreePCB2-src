1.323
-----
- compiled with VC++.net 2005
- fixes a few bugs.

1.322
-----
- fixes a few bugs that affected importing netlists into existing projects.

1.321
-----
- traces and copper areas are now preserved as much as possible when importing a netlist into an existing project, even if the net names have changed.
- several bugs are fixed that affected routing from pads on the bottom layer of edge connectors
- previously, if you were routing a ratline or a stub trace from a pin and you placed the first vertex within the outline of the starting pad, FreePCB would terminate the trace on the starting pin, creating a small circular trace. Circular traces are still allowed, but now they have to have at least 3 segments which should eliminate this problem.

1.320
-----
- fixes several bugs.
- when routing from non-grid points, FreePCB automatically generates an initial "dogleg" trace segment which is a combination of a vertical/horizontal segment and a segment at the snap angle. The end-point will always be on the grid. If you hold down the SHIFT key, the order of the segments will be reversed. If you hold down the CTRL key, FreePCB will revert back to its previous behavior of snapping to grid lines.
- when you save a project file, FreePCB will automatically rename the original file with the extension ".bak" before saving the new version.
- when autosaving, the project file will be saved in a subfolder of the project folder named "Autosave", with an extension between ".001" to ".025".

1.319
-----
- corrects several bugs related to nested coper areas and clearances around traces passing through copper areas.
- setting an SMT pad shape to "none" no longer crashes the "add/edit pin" function in the Footprint Editor.
- when editing a footprint with SMT pads on both the top and bottom layers, you can preserve the layer of the pads when applying your edit to multiple pins.

1.318
-----
Several bugs fixed:
- clearances for pads overlapping the edges of copper areas were not drawn correctly if the pad didn't use a thermal relief
- there was an error in the code for drawing copper areas inside cutouts in other copper areas
- clearances for pads overlapping the edges of copper areas inside cutouts were not drawn correctly

1.317
-----
2 bugs fixed:
- no dragging ratlines when moving a part
- a bug in "Add/Edit Part" that caused errors when adding or editing parts in the release version.

1.316
-----
- bug fixed

1.315
-----
Fixes the following bugs:
- undoing creation of a board outline or footprint polyline could leave an invisible polyline with one corner
- multiple board outlines were saved incorrectly
- clicking on the F9 button didn't work
- the CAM folder wasn't remembered after closing the dialog
- holes without pads were covered by the solder mask
- pads that extended beyond copper areas that they were connected to could create clearance violations or shorts to adjacent areas on other nets
- crashes on group operations

1.314
-----
- some bugsfixed
- improved support for branching traces.
- the function key menu has been changed slightly, with F9 now used for recalculating ratlines. This allows a more uniform assignment of the other keys.
- the Gerber format has been changed from 2.6 to 2.4. This means that the resolution of the Gerber files is now 0.1 mil instead of 0.001 mil. If this creates a problem for anybody, please let me know.

1.313
-----
- bugs fixed

1.312
-----
- projects can contain multiple board outlines.
- group copy/paste now handles all of the elements of the PCB, including board outlines. Therefore, it can be used to panelize a project.
- traces can have branches. To create a branch from a trace, select a vertex and press F3 (Connect Pin). Then draw the ratline to a pin on the same net (or unassigned). Then route the ratline as usual. Alternatively, a stub trace from a pin can be drawn to a vertex in a trace on the same net.

1.311
-----
- fixes a bug where zero-length stub traces were mistakenly deleted when saving a project.
- copper areas can now be placed inside cutouts in other areas.

1.310
-----
- bug fixed

1.309
-----
- fixes a bug in the group copy and paste commands where the part reference positions were not copied correctly.

1.308
-----
- adds copy and paste operations for groups of parts and traces.

1.307
-----
- fixes a bug which could cause saving a project to fail if there were connections consisting of a single zero-length segment.
- a new function "Tools->Check traces" has been added.

1.306
-----
- checks netlist files for PADS-PCB format before importing them.
- several bugs fixed

1.305
-----
Fixes a few bugs:
- routing a ratline to a different pin on the same net was sometimes handled incorrectly, resulting in a spurious connection
- when moving a part, ratlines were sometimes drawn incorrectly
- when adding a vertex to a segment, the cursor didn't include 45-degree reference lines
- removing a vertex from a trace could cause crashes if there were adjacent unrouted segments
- also, the Help->About dialog now indicates whether you are running a debug or release version

1.304
-----
Fixes two bugs:
- crashes on file operations when the Windows group policy "Do not keep history of recently opened documents" is enabled
- on some Group Move operations, stub trace segments were not made visible after the move

1.303
-----
- includes a patch by Arlen Cox that improves routing from off-grid points. Previously, if you were starting from an off-grid point, the snap angle would be disabled so you could get back on the grid. Now, the snap angle is maintained but you can snap to grid lines as well as points. This allows you to get back on the grid in a few segments without any funny angles. Please try it out and let me know what you think!
- a bug is fixed where the DRC would catch overlapping copper areas UNLESS one copper area was completely contained by the other.

1.302
-----
- several bugs are fixed, including errors in the DRC code for copper areas.
- some operations on copper areas are quite a bit faster
- cleaned up the code for vias. Previously, via sizes were actually a property of the adjacent segments, which didn't really make sense. Now, you can set the sizes of individual vias with F2 (Set Via Size). For end-vias on stub traces, where F2 was already used, you can use the right-click menu.
- the dialogs for setting trace and via widths now allow you to modify traces and vias independently. For example, with "Project>Nets>Change width(s)", you can change the size of all of the vias on multiple nets without affecting the trace widths, or vice versa
- you can add a vertex to a trace segment with F4 (Add Vertex), and when you delete a vertex between two routed segments on the same layer, they are replaced by a single routed segment (as suggested by NogginBoink and ChartreuseDog)
- Edit->Part now allows you to change the reference designator of the part (this was a highly-requested feature)
- Change Layer function added for copper areas

1.301
-----
- fixes a bug where pin names not ending in a number were not handled properly in the Footprint Editor.
- copper areas on the same net are checked for intersections after most editing operations, and automatically combined if possible.
- Tools->Combine Copper Areas menu item has been renamed Tools->Check Copper Areas, but it still combines intersecting areas if it finds them.

1.3
---
- fixes a bug where reimporting a netlist would result in traces between pins of a part being unrouted.
- a lot of changes in the code for copper areas.

1.205
-----
Fixes 2 bugs:
- crashes when making Gerber files with copper areas containing multiple arcs
- crashes if a footprint was created using mm but saved using mils, then the project was routed, saved and reopened.
When routing you can "back up" using the backspace key.

1.204
-----
- fixes a bug where FreePCB wouldn't find the default library folder if it was started from a shortcut that didn't specify the "start in" folder, and no project was loaded.
- fixes a bug where changing the shape of copper area sides wouldn't undo correctly, and a bug where adding a new pin in the Footprint Editor couldn't be cancelled by right-clicking and then wouldn't undo correctly.

1.203
-----
- corrects a few bugs in the Footprint Editor, mainly affecting the editing of pins.
- in the Add/Edit Pin dialog, you can apply new pin settings to existing pins.

1.202
-----
Corrects the following bugs:
- moving the origin when no board outline was defined caused a crash
- adding a part and dragging to position, then cancelling, then undoing with ^Z caused a crash
- in the Footprint Editor, adding a new pin caused a graphics glitch
- when creating a new project with > 4 layers, the colors for the copper layers were incorrect

1.201
-----
- corrects a bug where operations that resulted in adding or changing pin assignments to nets could not be undone correctly.
