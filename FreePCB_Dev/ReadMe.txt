FreePCB v1.325
--------------

This version adds support for importing and exporting files from/to the FreeRoute web-based autorouter. It also allows you to launch the autorouter from FreePCB.

Before trying to launch it from FreePCB, you should make sure that you can run it from the website at www.freerouting.net. You will have to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 on your system before using it from either the website or FreePCB.

To install, copy the files freepcb.exe, fpcroute.exe and freeroute.jnlp to the freepcb/bin directory.
